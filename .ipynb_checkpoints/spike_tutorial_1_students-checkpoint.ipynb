    "# Spike Tutorial -- Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set is recorded from auditory cortex in an awake mouse. This was a VGAT-cre mouse that was injected with a FLEX-ChR2 virus, which encodes an excitatory opsin that will selectively express in VGAT cells in this mouse line. The idea here is that when you shine blue light on the injection site, inhibitory VGAT neurons (VGAT is a pan-inhibitory neuronal marker) will activate, and through massive inhibition shut down most of the other neurons in the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there were several stimuli run during this recording, we will focus on only one of them: a set of dynamic random chord (DRC) stimuli which alternate between low and high contrast, interleaved with laser stimulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Neural Data\n",
    "This is spiking data recorded from a laminar probe. We'll focus mostly on one neuron in this notebook, but there are about 50 neurons in this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not familiar working with spike recordings, there a few important things you need:\n",
    "1. **The spike times:** here, these are contained in a file called spike_times.npy, and are coded in samples from the start of the recording.\n",
    "2. **Event times:** these are trigger times (typically in the form of 5 volt square pulses) that are locked to stimulus events (in our case, contrast transitions and laser pulse onsets and offsets).\n",
    "3. **Spike identity:** having a lot of spikes is not necessarily useful unless you know which neurons they come from. Spike identity is usually assigned during spike sorting.\n",
    "4. **Stimulus information:** knowing which stimulus was presented when is *essential*. The usual practice is to save some sort of stimulus index that assigns which stimulus is associated with which event time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are the basics, we'll cover the details as we go!\n",
    "\n",
    "First lets import useful modules that we're already familiar with (numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and os for path stuff)\n"

    "\n",
    "*messages* are events that are manually typed into the recording computer at different parts of the recording. They're good for logging stimulus blocks, notes about recording quality, or errors. They have two important aspects, the text of the message and the time it was logged.\n",
